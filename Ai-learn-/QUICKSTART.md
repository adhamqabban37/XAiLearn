# 🚀 FIRESTORE SECURITY - QUICK START GUIDE

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

```powershell
# Install testing dependencies
npm install

# Install Firebase CLI globally
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### Step 2: Login to Firebase (1 minute)

```powershell
firebase login
```

This will open your browser - login with your Google account.

### Step 3: Initialize Firebase (OPTIONAL - if not already done)

```powershell
firebase init
```

- Select **Firestore** (use spacebar to select, enter to confirm)
- Use existing project or create new one
- Accept default file names (`firestore.rules`, `firestore.indexes.json`)

### Step 4: Test Rules with Emulator (1 minute)

Open **TWO terminals**:

**Terminal 1** - Start emulator:

```powershell
npm run emulator:firestore
```

Wait for: `✔  firestore: Firestore Emulator running on http://localhost:8080`

**Terminal 2** - Run security tests:

```powershell
npm run test:security
```

Expected output:

```
✓ All tests passed (40+ tests)
```

### Step 5: Deploy to Production (30 seconds)

```powershell
npm run deploy:rules
```

Expected output:

```
✔  Deploy complete!
```

### Step 6: Verify in Firebase Console

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** → **Rules**
4. Verify rules are active ✅

## 🔥 ONE-COMMAND DEPLOYMENT

If you're in a hurry and trust the rules (after reviewing):

```powershell
# Deploy immediately (PRODUCTION)
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

8. **`QUICKSTART.md`** - This file

### Package.json Scripts Added:

- `npm run emulator` - Start all Firebase emulators
- `npm run emulator:firestore` - Start Firestore emulator only

## 🛡️ SECURITY GUARANTEES

Your database is now protected against:

✅ Unauthenticated access
✅ Cross-user data access
✅ Data tampering
✅ Privilege escalation
✅ Injection attacks
✅ DoS attacks
✅ Time manipulation
✅ Email spoofing
✅ Certificate fraud
✅ Ownership transfer

---

## 🧪 TESTING LOCALLY

### Interactive Testing with Emulator UI

```powershell
# Start emulator with UI
npm run emulator
```

Then open: http://localhost:4000

You can:

- View Firestore data
- Test rules manually
- Simulate different users
- See real-time rule evaluation

---

## 📝 EXAMPLE: TESTING WITH YOUR APP

### 1. Update Your Firebase Config

Make sure your `lib/firebase.ts` includes:

```typescript
import { getFirestore, connectFirestoreEmulator } from "firebase/firestore";

const db = getFirestore(app);

// Connect to emulator in development
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  connectFirestoreEmulator(db, "localhost", 8080);
}
```

### 2. Test User Signup

```typescript
// This should work - creating own profile
const user = auth.currentUser;
await setDoc(doc(db, "users", user.uid), {
  email: user.email,
  displayName: "Test User",
  createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
  updatedAt: serverTimestamp(),
});
```

### 3. Test Unauthorized Access

```typescript
// This should FAIL - accessing another user's data
try {
  await getDoc(doc(db, "users", "another-user-id"));
  console.log("❌ SECURITY BREACH!");
} catch (error) {
  console.log("✅ Security working - access denied");
}
```

---

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Error: "Cannot find module '@firebase/rules-unit-testing'"

```powershell
npm install --save-dev @firebase/rules-unit-testing @types/jest jest ts-jest
```

### Error: "Emulator not running"

```powershell
# Kill any existing emulator processes
taskkill /F /IM java.exe

# Start fresh
npm run emulator:firestore
```

### Error: "Permission denied" in production

1. Check Firebase Console Rules tab
2. Verify rules are deployed
3. Check user is authenticated: `auth.currentUser`
4. Verify document path matches user ID

---

## 📊 MONITORING

### View Rule Evaluation in Real-Time

While emulator is running, check:

```
http://localhost:4000/firestore
```

Click on any document and see **Rule Evaluation** panel.

### Production Monitoring

Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Usage

- Monitor denied requests
- Track read/write counts
- Alert on unusual patterns

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ Rules deployed
2. ✅ Tests passing
3. ⬜ Update your app to use Firestore properly
4. ⬜ Test with real user accounts
5. ⬜ Monitor for permission errors
6. ⬜ Set up CI/CD for automatic testing
