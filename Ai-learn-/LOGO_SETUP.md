# Logo Setup Instructions

## ✅ Code Changes Complete!

I've updated the logo components to display your logo image next to "AI Learn" and "AI Course Crafter" text.

## 📋 Next Step: Add Your Logo File

To complete the setup, you need to add your logo image file:

1. **Locate your logo file** named `logo.jpg` (the tech-themed letter X logo)
2. **Copy it to the public folder**:
   ```
   c:\Users\Tyson\Desktop\ai learn2.0\Ai-learn-\public\logo.jpg
   ```

## 🎨 What Was Changed

### Updated Files:

#### 1. `src/components/common/logo.tsx`

- Changed image source from `/logo.svg` to `/logo.jpg`
- Updated layout to show logo with stacked text:
  - **Top line**: "AI Learn" (larger, bold)
  - **Bottom line**: "AI Course Crafter" (smaller, muted)
- Added `rounded-md` styling to the logo image
- Adjusted spacing for better visual balance

#### 2. `src/components/common/header.tsx`

- Increased header height from `h-14` to `h-16` for better logo visibility
- Removed duplicate "AI Course Crafter" text (now shown inside Logo component)
- Simplified header structure

## 🖼️ Expected Result

After adding `logo.jpg`, the header will display:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [X Logo]  AI Learn              Dashboard  Sign In │
│            AI Course Crafter                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🚀 Testing

After adding the logo file:

1. Refresh your browser at http://localhost:9002
2. You should see your X logo next to the text in the top-left corner
3. The logo will appear on all pages (home, dashboard, lesson view, etc.)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If the logo doesn't appear:

- Verify the file is named exactly `logo.jpg` (case-sensitive)
- Check the file is in the `public` folder
- Clear your browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for any image loading errors

## 📐 Logo Specifications

The logo is currently configured for:

- Size: 40x40 pixels
- Format: JPG
- Style: Rounded corners with `rounded-md`

If you need different sizing or styling, let me know!
