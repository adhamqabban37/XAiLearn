## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Calm blue (#5DADE2) to evoke feelings of trust and competence. This is in contrast to the background and provides clarity for text.
- Background color: Light, desaturated blue (#E8F6FF) to ensure readability and a calm learning environment. It shares the same hue as the primary but is less intense.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#A98DDA) to highlight interactive elements and important information. Being analogous to blue, it gives some vibrancy without being distracting.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) offers a balance of modernity and readability suitable for long-form learning content.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use clear, intuitive icons for navigation and interactive elements within the lessons.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout with clear visual hierarchy to guide learners through the content.
- Use subtle animations for feedback and progress updates to enhance user engagement without distraction.
